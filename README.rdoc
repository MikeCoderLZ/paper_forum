== README

Paper Forum is a Rails-based internet forum, developed as an experiment
in creating a cleaner forum experience.

It is developed in Ruby 4.2.1.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running. I haven't gotten to that yet. More to follow.
