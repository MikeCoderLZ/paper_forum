What we have so far:

Boards can be created and destroyed.
Boards know of their parent and their children.
Boards display their immediate children.
Users exist, and have a name and email address attribute.
Rudimentary intro screen and redirect to creating a new user, but
it goes nowhere.

--------------

User needs to validate it's current attributes.
